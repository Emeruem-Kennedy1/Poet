# Poet Programming Language
This is a programming language that allows users to write code in a poetic way. It is a work in progress.

### Type Creation
- **Syntax**: `Define Types: word1, word2, word3 as Arrays; word4, word5 as Integer;`
- **Functionality**: Users define custom keywords to represent standard data types.

### Descriptors
- **Syntax**: `Descriptor: My, Our, Their;`
- **Functionality**: Users define descriptors to add a personal or contextual touch to variable declarations.

### Assigners
- **Syntax**: `Assigner: called, of;`
- **Functionality**: Users define assigners to introduce the value assignment in a poetic way.

### Variable Assignment Structure
- **Format**: `[descriptor] [variable] is a [type] called [poetic completer] (value)`
- **Components**:
  - `[descriptor]`: User-defined, adds a unique touch.
  - `[variable]`: Name of the variable.
  - `[type]`: Data type as defined in the setup.
  - `[poetic completer]`: Artistic phrase completing the statement.
  - `(value)`: Actual value in parentheses for clarity.
- **Example**: 
  - `"My house is a shell called my former self (1)"`
    - `My`: Descriptor, as defined in setup.
    - `house`: Variable name.
    - `shell`: Data type as seen in the initial setup.
    - `my former self`: Poetic completer, enhancing the statement artistically.
    - `(1)`: The actual value being assigned to `house`.
